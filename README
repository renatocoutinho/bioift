These are a collection of small (and some not so small) programs written and
used by the Mathematical Biology group at the Institute for Theoretical Physics
(Instituto de Física Teórica, IFT) of State University of Sao Paulo (Unesp).
The group is headed by Prof. Dr. Roberto Kraenkel <kraenkel@ift.unesp.br>.

They are written mainly in python, usually with numpy/scipy and matplotlib for
plotting, but also with sympy and fipy sometimes. There may also be some C and
Fortran programs eventually.

More about the group and its members can be found at:
